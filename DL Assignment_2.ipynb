    "Structure of an Artificial Neuron and Similarities to a Biological Neuron:\n",
    "   An artificial neuron, often referred to as a perceptron, is a fundamental building block of artificial neural networks (ANNs). It is designed to mimic some aspects of a biological neuron while simplifying the underlying biological complexity. The main components of an artificial neuron include:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Inputs (x1, x2, ..., xn): These are analogous to the dendrites of a biological neuron. Inputs carry signals to the artificial neuron.\n",
    "   - Weights (w1, w2, ..., wn): Weights represent the strength or importance of each input signal. They are similar to synapses in biological neurons.\n",
    "   - Summation Function (Σ): The artificial neuron calculates the weighted sum of its inputs: \\[ \\text{Sum} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (w_i \\cdot x_i) \\]\n",
    "   - Activation Function (f): The activation function determines the output of the neuron based on the weighted sum. It introduces non-linearity and is similar to the firing threshold of a biological neuron.\n",
    "   - Output (y): The output is the final result produced by the neuron after applying the activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Similarities to a Biological Neuron:\n",
    "   - Inputs are weighted, representing the influence of incoming signals.\n",
    "   - The neuron processes inputs to produce an output based on a threshold (in the case of a threshold activation function).\n",
    "   - Weight adjustments during learning are analogous to the strengthening or weakening of synapses in biological neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the different types of activation functions popularly used? Explain each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Activation Functions:\n",
    "   Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the neural network, allowing it to learn complex relationships. Some popular activation functions include:\n",
    "   - Step Function (Threshold Function): This binary function produces a 1 if the input is above a threshold and 0 otherwise. It's often used in early models like the perceptron.\n",
    "   - Sigmoid Function (Logistic Function): This function maps input values to the range (0, 1) and is commonly used in the hidden layers of neural networks. It smooths out the output.\n",
    "   - ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit): The ReLU function outputs the input if it's positive and 0 otherwise. It's computationally efficient and helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "   - Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent): Similar to the sigmoid, but maps input values to the range (-1, 1). It's useful in scenarios where zero-centered outputs are desired.\n",
    "   - Softmax Function: This function is used in the output layer for multi-class classification tasks. It converts a vector of inputs into a probability distribution over multiple classes.\n",

    "\n",
    "   - Example with (w0, w1, w2) = (-1, 2, 1): Using these weights, you can classify data points (x1, x2) as follows:\n",
    "     - (3, 4): Output = (-1 * 1) + (2 * 3) + (1 * 4) = 9 > 0 (perceptron fires).\n",
    "     - (5, 2): Output = (-1 * 1) + (2 * 5) + (1 * 2) = 11 > 0 (perceptron fires).\n",
    "     - (1, -3): Output = (-1 * 1) + (2 * 1) + (1 * (-3)) = -2 < 0 (perceptron does not fire).\n",
    "     - (-8, -3): Output = (-1 * 1) + (2 * (-8)) + (1 * (-3)) = -15 < 0 (perceptron does not fire).\n",
    "     - (-3, 0): Output = (-1 * 1) + (2 * (-3)) + (1 * 0) = -7 < 0 (perceptron does not fire).\n",
